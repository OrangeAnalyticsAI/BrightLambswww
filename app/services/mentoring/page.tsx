        6. Embedding Capability into Delivery
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
        The ultimate goal is better client delivery. Analysts who train on BAA.ac and benefit from

      <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          <span className="font-medium">It embodies our belief in people:</span> By investing in
          learning and mentoring, we uphold BA capability as a skill that grows with support, not
          something that can simply be inherited.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-medium">It sets high standards:</span> With BAA.ac as our "gold
          standard", every analyst works within the same framework, delivering reliable quality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-medium">It scales impact:</span> As we build capability internally,
          we also nurture BA talent externally, expanding confidence and competence in the
          profession.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-medium">It deepens client outcomes:</span> Better-trained analysts
          design more effective processes, drive adoption more smoothly, and capture value more
          consistently.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-700">
        At Bright Lambs, mentoring and capability building are not just nice to have, they are
        mission-critical. Through structured mentorship, shared learning via BAA.ac, and a
        supportive community, we unleash the human potential behind every transformation.
