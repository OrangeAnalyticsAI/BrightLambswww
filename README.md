# Business Analysis Academy

A modern web application for the Business Analysis Academy, built with Next.js, React, and Supabase. The aim of the application is to host courses and resources as well as information on Tools for business analysis professionals. Users will be able to view the what courses and resources are available, but to be able to view and download them then they will have to register and login. The exception is publically available resources, like YouTube videos or links to other websites, which they can follow without registering.

User registration will involve them completing a questionnaire to help us understand their background and interests. This will help us to better understand their needs and provide them with the most relevant content. As well as gain insights into their ability to be a good BA.
